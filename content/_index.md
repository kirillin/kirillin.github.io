Welcome! My name is Kirill Artemov.

I am roboticist with a [PhD](https://dissovet.itmo.ru/dissertation/?number=743695), specializing in software development.

Now I am
- leading a university course on robot programming, where students develop Python3-based physics simulators and advanced control systems.
- writing an open online book (inspired by [Algorithmica](https://en.algorithmica.org/)) to make robotics algorithms bridging theory and practice.
- building a bipedal walking robot; follow the journey on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/SvAR9CiDKxs) (coming soon!).
- leveling up my C++ and classical algorithms to tackle industry challenges and technical interviews.


My stack includes:
- python3, C++, MATLAB
- ubuntu, i3, docker
- classical mechanics, math

Iâ€™m open to discussions, project ideas, or opportunities in robotics/software.
